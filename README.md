# The 00s Indie Band Database
This is official home of the 00s Indie Band Database, which collects information and statistics on the indie music scene of the mid-2000s. Each row represents a band, and each column represents a variable.

The database was originally created by [Duncan Geere](http://www.duncangeere.com) in April and May 2019, and was last updated on 16 May 2019.

## Variables
* **Name**: Band name

* **Home Country**: The country where the band formed or is based in
* **Latitude**: Latitude of the above city

* **Legendary**: A subjective marker of the bands that were most influential
* **Albums**: Number of studio albums released. EPs, live albums and greatest hits compilations don't count
* **Guitars to Synths**: Subjective rating on a 1-5 scale where 1 represents an almost total absence of synthesizers and 5 represents an almost total absence of guitars.

* **Loudness**: Subjective rating on a 1-5 scale where 1 represents quieter, acoustic bands and 5 represents louder, more distorted/electric bands.
* **Loudness**: Subjective rating on a 1-5 scale where 1 represents the least cool bands and 5 represents the most cool bands.

* **Last album**: Release date of the band's most recent album. In a few instances, I used the first day of the month to represent albums where the precise date wasn't known.

## Some FAQs:
### How comprehensive is this? 
It's a work in progress, but I think it's pretty good. It definitely covers all of the top-tier and the vast majority of the mid-tier acts in the British and US indie scenes during the 00s. I've got a form [here](https://airtable.com/shrURbhInIQB2TEem) that allows anyone to submit additional acts that aren't currently in the database.

### What are the criteria for inclusion?
I'm defining "indie" fairly loosely, as "musicians and bands that the NME got excited about in the 00s". This means that e.g. The Streets and Amy Winehouse are "indie", and Coldplay are not, which some might find questionable, but the objective is to document a particular scene. The former examples were definitely part of and influenced that scene, the latter is is not and did not.

### You forgot to include my favourite band!
There are two reasons why your favourite band might not be in here. The first is that I might have decided it didn't quite fit into the scene. Coldplay, for example, are absolutely a mid-00s indie band, but they didn't really give or take influence from anyone else here. The other reason is that I might have forgotten about them. In either case you should [check if they're already in the 00s indie band database](https://airtable.com/shrtIJTzbEXDvBvQ5), and [add them if they're not there](https://airtable.com/shrURbhInIQB2TEem).

### Can I use this data in my project?
Absolutely, yes, as long as you credit "The 00s Indie Band Database" with a link to this page: http://www.duncangeere.com/00sindiebanddatabase/.
